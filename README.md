The ThermodoSDK allows you to integrate [Thermodo](http://thermodo.com) into your iOS application. ThermodoSDK provides a simple interface for interacting with Thermodo and getting temperature readings into your application.

Thermodo is a tiny electrical thermometer for your mobile device that lets you measure the temperature right where you are. For more information about Thermodo please checkout our [website](http://thermodo.com) or watch the [Kickstarter Video](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/robocat/thermodo-the-tiny-thermometer-for-mobile-devices).

## Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-part libraries like ThermodoSDK in your application. See their website for a [Getting started guide](http://docs.cocoapods.org/guides/installing_cocoapods.html).

In your projects Podfile add ThermodoSDK and run ``pod install``

**Podfile**
```ruby
platform :ios, '7.0'
pod "ThermodoSDK", "~> 1.0"
```

## Manual installation

We highly encourage you to use CocoaPods for installation so you're always up to date with the latest version. If you don't want to use CocoaPods you can of course still install ThermodoSDK manually.

1. Download the lastest [version](https://github.com/thermodo/ThermodoSDK-iOS)
2. Drag all the ``.h`` and ``.a`` files into your Xcode project.
3. Make sure that the location where you put the libThermodoSDK.a is in your "Library Search Path" (Under your targets build settings).
4. Add ``-lThermodoSDK`` to "Other Linker Flags" in your targets build settings.
5. That's it!

## Usage

To get started you need to register a delegate so your application can ``start`` and``stop`` the measurements and get temperature readings from the device. Your delegate must implement the ``THMThermodoDelegate`` protocol.

```objectivec
@protocol THMThermodoDelegate <NSObject>

@optional

/*!
 * If this method is implemented, it will get called after -start has been called and
 * whenever something is plugged into or out of the headphone jack.
 * @param thermodo The shared THMThermodo instance
 */
- (BOOL)thermodoShouldUseAudioInputAsThermodoDevice:(THMThermodo *)thermodo;

/*!
 * This method will be called when -start is called on TMThermodo while the device is plugged in
 * or once the device has been plugged in after -start has been called.
 * @param thermodo The shared THMThermodo instance
 */
- (void)thermodoDidStartMeasuring:(THMThermodo *)thermodo;

/*!
 * This method will be called when -stop is called on TMThermodo or when the device is unplugged.
 * @param thermodo The shared THMThermodo instance
 */
- (void)thermodoDidStopMeasuring:(THMThermodo *)thermodo;

/*!
 * This method will be called every time the Thermodo device returns a new temperature reading.
 * @param thermodo The shared THMThermodo instance
 * @param temperature The measured temperature in celsius
 */
- (void)thermodo:(THMThermodo *)thermodo didGetTemperature:(CGFloat)temperature;

@end
```

To start measuring simply register your delegate and ask the ``THMThermodo`` instance to start measuring:

```objectivec
@interface MyViewController () <THMThermodoDelegate>
@end

@implementation MyViewController

- (void)viewDidLoad {
	[super viewDidLoad];

	[[THMThermodo sharedThermodo] setDelegate:self];
	[[THMThermodo sharedThermodo] start];
}

- (void)thermodo:(THMThermodo *)thermodo didGetTemperature:(CGFloat)temperature {
	// Display the temperature reading
}

@end
```

In this example we simply use our View Controller as the delegate for Thermodo. While this works perfectly fine you probably want to have your delegate decoupled from your View Controllers if you need to access the Thermodo readings from several places since there can only be one delegate for the Thermodo device.

## FAQ

### Why is it not compatible with OS X?

We're hard at work at making a OS X compatible version of ThermodoSDK. All the basic functionality is there, we just need to nail the final details down.

### Can I try/use ThermodoSDK without a Thermodo Device?

No. In order to get device readings and any kind of reponse from SDK you must have Thermodo device to test with. You can order one from [our website](http://thermodo.com).

### The readings from the device are too hot

We have used a lot of time on making sure that Thermodo delivers accurate and consistent temperature readings. Unfortunately this precision also means that the Thermodo
sensor is easily affected by heat from your device (your iPhone / iPad / Macbook) or just the palm of your hand. To get the most accurate readings we recommend using an extension cord. For more information [this video update from the Kickstarter project](http://vimeo.com/76458958).
